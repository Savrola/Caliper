/**
 * The various Garnett session types.

 * Session typing is mostly relevant for server sessions since they use the session type to vet the types
 * of messages that they can receive based on what sort of authentication has been performed by the client.
 * Client sessions may but do not necessarily use their session type to track what they expect the type of
 * their corresponding server session type to be.
 * <p/>
 * Note that the session types are sorted according to the rule that a session of type X may be changed to a session
 * of type Y if and only iff X &lt;= Y.
