/**
 * Provide a way to sort data while automatically dealing with duplicate keys.
 * Analogous to a {@link TreeMap} except that the key-value associates are one-to-many.
 * For example, a single tree sorter can contain both <tt>fred</tt>-><tt>hello</tt> and <tt>fred</tt>-><tt>world</tt> associations.
 * <p/>
 * There is no <tt>get()</tt> method.  See the {@link #getValues} method for the presumably obvious analogous method.
 * <p/>
 * Duplicate entries are supported in the sense that if two
 * identical associations are placed into the sorter than the value associated with these two equal entries will
 * appear twice when the sorter is traversed using its iterator (equal entries appear
 * via the iterator in the same order that they were added to the sorter).
 * For example, if the association <tt>fred</tt>-><tt>hello</tt> is already in the tree sorter when the association
 * <tt>fred</tt>-><tt>hello</tt> is added to the tree sorter then a scan through all of the values associated with
 * <tt>fred</tt> will yield <tt>hello</tt> more than once.
 * <p/>
 * If two or more different associations which both use the same key are added to the tree sorter then a scan
 * through all of the values associated with the key will yield the values in the same order that their associations
 * were added to the tree sorter.
 * For example, if the associations <tt>fred</tt>-><tt>how</tt>, <tt>fred</tt>-><tt>are</tt>,
 * <tt>fred</tt>-><tt>you</tt> and <tt>fred</tt>-><tt>today</tt>
 * are added to a previously empty tree sorter in the specified order then a scan of all of the values associated with
 * the key <tt>fred</tt> will yield <tt>how</tt>, <tt>are</tt>, <tt>you</tt> and <tt>today</tt> in that order.
 * <p/>
 * Instances of this class are serializable if both the key and content objects
 * used to create the instance are serializable.
